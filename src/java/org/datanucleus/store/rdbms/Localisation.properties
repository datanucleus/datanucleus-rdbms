020000=Persistent class "{0}" has no table in the database, but the operation requires it. Please check the specification of the MetaData for this class.
020001=Field has no corresponding database column : {0}
020003=Columns "{0} " have been defined with {1} columns, yet there are only {2} to map to!
020004=Columns "{0}" has a column "{1}" which has been defined to map to column "{2}" but this doesn't exist!
020005=Columns "{0}" column number {1} has no remaining columns to map to!
020006=Columns "{0}" has a column "{1}" that has been mapped twice!
020007=Duplicate column name "{0}" defined for table "{1}". You cannot map multiple fields to the same column. The duplicated columns are specified by {2} and {3}. See also persistence property "datanucleus.rdbms.allowColumnReuse"
020008=? datastore-identity|index columns|other non mapped to any field ?
020009=Incompatible data type for column {0} : was {1} (datastore), but type expected was {2} (metadata). Please check that the type in the datastore and the type specified in the MetaData are consistent.
020010=Required columns missing from table "{0}" : {1}. Perhaps your MetaData is incorrect, or you haven't enabled "datanucleus.autoCreateColumns".
020011=Required table missing : "{2}" in Catalog "{0}" Schema "{1}". DataNucleus requires this table to perform its persistence operations. Either your MetaData is incorrect, or you need to enable "datanucleus.autoCreateTables"
020012=Table "{0}" is of wrong type {1}. Should be a table
020013=Table "{0}" is of wrong type {1}. Should be a view
020014=Cannot define a primary key column in a view : {0}, column={1}
020015=Exceeded maximum of {0} foreign keys for table {1}
020016=Exceeded maximum of {0} index keys for table {1}
020017=Invalid view definition for {0} : {1}
020018=Wrong precision for column {0} : was {1} (according to the JDBC driver) but should be {2} (based on the MetaData definition).
020019=Wrong precision for column {0} : was {1} (according to the JDBC driver) but should be {2} (based on the MetaData definition for field {3}).
020020=Expected primary key for table {0} {1} not found in existing keys {2}
020021=Wrong scale for column {0} : was {1} (according to the JDBC driver) but should be {2} (based on the MetaData definition).
020022=Wrong scale for column {0} : was {1} (according to the JDBC driver) but should be {2} (based on the MetaData definition for field {3}).
020023=Classes backed by views cannot have persistence-capable superclasses : {0}
020024=Unexpected column {0} encountered in table {1} schema {2} catalog {3}
020025=Column {0} should not allow nulls but does. You can prevent nulls by specifying "allows-null" as "false" for the <field> in the MetaData

020183=Column {0} has been specified with precision/scale, yet the column datastore type doesn't allow specification of this
020184=Invalid precision, column = {0}

# This is type info so move to different range!
020191=Data type {0} is not recognized by the JDBC. Validation will be ignored
020192=You have specified the default {0} as {1} but for this datastore this has been changed to {2}. This is likely due to missing quote characters, or the datastore storing things in a different case

#
# Query ResultExpressions
#
021033=Query cannot create object of type "{0}" since specified constructor "{1}" doesn't exist

021051="HAVING" expression "{0}" is not a valid boolean expression

021062=Query has reference to member "{0}" of class "{1}" yet this doesnt exist!

021074=The expression {0} is not supported in results.

021118=Query has parameter "{0}" declared as "{1}" yet a value of type "{2}" was supplied

021213=Cannot select multi-valued objects in a result clause of a query

#
# Views
#
031004=Validating view : {0}
031005=Class "{0}" has been defined with an identity-type of "{1}". SQL Views cannot be used with this type. You must use "nondurable".
031006=Class "{0}" has been defined with field "{1}" with a persistence-modifier of "{2}". You cannot use this with SQL Views - must be persistent or transactional.
031007=Class "{0}" uses an SQL View, however the method "{1}" has just been called. This is not supported for SQL Views.
031008=Class "{0}" uses an SQL View consequently DataNucleus doesnt support the generation of new identities for objects of this type.
031009=Class "{0}" uses an SQL View, however you are not allowed to use macros (such as "{1}") in the view definition.

#
# Mapping
#
041000=The Java type {0} has no known mapping class available in DataNucleus.

041015=Cannot assign field to an object from a different PersistenceManager
041016=Object is not a PersistenceCapable instance. Object class = {0}, value = {1}

041018=Object "{0}" has field "{1}" with a 1-1 bidirectional relation set to relate to "{2}" but this object hasnt had the relation at field "{3}" set so updating the object directly.
041019=Object "{0}" has bidirectional field "{1}" currently set to "{2}" but this object is being deleted so nulling this field
041020=Object "{0}" has field "{1}" with a 1-1 bidirectional relation set to relate to "{2}" but this object relates back to a different object "{3}"!

041022=Object "{0}" has field "{1}" with an N-1 bidirectional relation set to relate to "{2}" but the collection at "{3}" doesn't contain this object.
041023=Specified field "{0}" has no container (collection/map/array) MetaData!

041034=Retrieved object with OID "{0}"

041038=Primary Key column "{0}" for table "{1}" is not mapped.

041042=Field "{0}" is specified as embedded. DataNucleus doesnt currently support the persistence of embedded Object fields.

041044=Field "{0}" is a reference field (interface/Object) of type {1} but DataNucleus is unable to assign an object of type "{2}" to this field. You can only assign this field to a type specified by the "implementation-classes" extension attribute.

050012=Schema Data has not been initialised for Catalog "{0}", Schema "{1}"
050013=Class "{0}" has been specified to use an inheritance strategy of "superclass-table", yet the table for a superclass cannot be found!
050014=Class "{0}" has been specified as "embedded-only", and so it can only exist within the tables of other classes. No table will be created.
050015=The class specified ({0}) has a default table name of {1}, but this is in use by a different class ({2}). DataNucleus will use a separate instance of this table internally and data will be persisted to the same datastore table.

057002=Table has not been validated : {0}
057003=Attempt to create table for class {0} which has been specified to use an inheritance strategy of "{1}". This means it should not have its own table.
057004=No identity not supported for class {0}
057005=Invalid identity type for class {0}
057006=Invalid persistence-modifier for field {0}
057007=The field "{0}" represents a map with the key stored as a field in the value, yet the field specified ({1}) isnt found in the value class.
057008=The field "{0}" represents a map with the value stored as a field in the key, yet the field specified ({1}) isnt found in the key class.
057009=The field "{0}" represents a map with no join table. In this case you must specify "mapped-by" on either the key or the value element to specify that either the key is stored in the value class, or that the value is stored in the key class.
057010=Field [{0}] -> Column(s) [{1}] using mapping of type "{2}" ({3})
057011=There is no field associated with the column [{0}] using the type "{1}"
057012=More than one map has its "mapped-by" attribute set to field "{0}" (for example field "{1}"). This could cause a problem since objects of this class can, as a result, be part of multiple relationships and so functionality like dependent-field may not work reliably.

057040=Table "{0}" has been specified with a primary-key to include column "{1}" but this column is not found in the table. Please check your <primary-key> column specification.
057041=The Key Type provided for the Map field {0} uses a column that was already used by the Type Value of the Map field.
057042=The Value Type provided for the Map field {0} uses a column that was already used by the Type Key of the Map field.
057043=The column "{0}" exists in table "{1}" and has invalid metadata. The existing column is "{2}"
057044=The column "{0}" exists in table "{1}" and cannot be validated because a duplicated column has been specified and the metadata is invalid. The column is "{2}"
