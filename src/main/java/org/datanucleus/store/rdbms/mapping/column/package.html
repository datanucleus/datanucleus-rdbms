    <P>Package containing mappings for column (JDBC) types. These mappings will be mapped via the MappingManager to 
        the various java type mappings in org.datanucleus.store.rdbms.mapping.java</P>
    <P>These are column (JDBC) types, and probably most of them are atomic types mapping to atomic java types</P>
    <P>
        Mappings map persistent java fields in persistable classes to columns in RDBMS tables. 
        Mappings are also used to map "non-fields" in persistable classes to columns in RDBMS tables. 
        A class using datastore identity does not have java fields representing primary-keys in RDBMS tables, but as said earlier a Mapping is also applied to "non-fields". 
        Therefore, a Mapping is applied to:
    </P>
    <UL>
        <LI>persistent java fields</LI>
        <LI>datastore identity (primary-key columns)</LI>
        <LI>optimistic columns (columns with version numbers)</LI>
        <LI>index columns (columns indexing an ordered list)</LI>
        <LI>owner columns in unidirectional inverse relationships</LI>
        <LI>adapter columns (additional column added as primary key when the existing columns have datatype not allowed, by database limitation, to be part of the primary key)</LI>
    </UL>
    <P>
        In addition to the representation of columns in tables for persistable classes, column mappings are also used for representing columns in queries.
